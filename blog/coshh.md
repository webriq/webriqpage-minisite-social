**Control of Substances Hazardous to Health**

Understanding COSHH is vital to anyone using, handling or disposing of chemicals.

The COSHH Data Sheet contains information regarding use, protection, First Aid and safe disposal.

The proactive driver for safe use of chemicals has always come through accident investigations but more recently through compliance documents such as ISO14001 (Environmental Management Systems).

The over-riding objective is always to identity safer products that don’t need a COSHH Data Sheet, basically applying the first recommended step in risk assessment: ‘remove the hazard’.

The alternative is to depend on the human application of a safe system of work for using and controlling the hazardous chemical.

When using hazardous chemicals, training in their use and understanding of the nature of the hazard are vital. The safe system of work must clearly identify the negative outcome that will result on both the person using the product and the surrounding environment.

Non-compliance with COSHH regulations will leave you open to criminal prosecution through the Health & Safety at Work Act.
