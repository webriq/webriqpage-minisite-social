  Questions about an uncertain future of H&amp;S regulation after BREXIT;

Will continue in the status quo?

Will become more burdensome?

Will be diluted?

The only answer at this stage can be “Not sure”

Before jumping to conclusions, there are facts and history relative to H&amp;S in the UK worth considering

Since H&amp;S regulation began, the UK has had most robust regulation in the world

Misconceptions about the best H&amp;S standards; not Sweden (Volvo’s reputation?) or Germany (modern manufacturing and reliable transport systems)

We shouldn’t make assumptions but wouldn’t it be reasonable to suggest that, given our reputation for placing a high value on H&amp;S, it would continue as a ‘natural response’?

The European Norms were developed mostly from existing British Standards

Recent revisions of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 were carried out by the UK Government, not the European Government

In summary, it’s unlikely that a UK Government would look to undo the robust regulation in favour of untried or diluted alternatives  Questions about an uncertain future of H&S regulation after BREXIT;
