##### It sounds condescending but, in years of recruiting, I’ve seen so many applications go in the bin because they are incomplete!

**Security companies need to comply with *BS 7858:2012* Security screening of individuals employed in a security environment**


Why comply? Insurance, Association Membership, Industry Standards such as Approved Contractor (ACS), other British Standards and SIA Licensing Regulations all depend on compliance.

**The basic elements are:**

* 	5 yr history of home addresses, to complete a DBS checks. The disclosure will confirm your addresses’ and confirm unspent criminal convictions
* 	5 years employment, self employment, unemployment history
* 	Any unconfirmed dates will be queried and will hinder any offer of employment
* 	A Credit Check is carried out to identify any CCJs
* 	Character References, most companies will ask for two. They will confirm they have known you for the previous 2 years but preferably 5. Referees can’t be relatives or living at the same address
