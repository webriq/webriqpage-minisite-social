**Historic Child Abuse, how can you help to stop this rot?**

The world of Football has been rocked by the shameful actions of a few, ask yourself; what could you do to avoid this happening in your industry?

Few recognise situations that leave the vulnerable at risk so protective procedures never get considered.

Organisations don’t seem to know they’ve failed the vulnerable until a scandal breaks, then it’s too late.

**Your options?**

1.      You could do nothing (and hope)

2.      You could be proactive; create a robust Safeguarding Policy and train your staff so you’ll discourage these unsavoury characters from starting or continuing their vile trade under your nose.

There’s a moral obligation to look out for the vulnerable but there’s also a legal obligation.

Failure to address your moral obligations in business will leave your company reputation in tatters.

Failure to comply with your legal obligations will find you in the criminal court and, later, the civil court.

Take the initiative, get Safeguarding on your next agenda, get a policy, train your staff and sleep easier at night.
