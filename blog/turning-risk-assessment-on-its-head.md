  I’d like to share a Research Article from Mr Rosness Ragnar, SINTEF Norway [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14773996.2016.1255443](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14773996.2016.1255443)

The common approach for Risk Assessment (RA) is to focus on the higher risk practices and input rules to develop a ‘Suitable and Sufficient’ RA.

This article turns that thinking on its head by analysing ‘Successful Operations’ instead.

By their nature, successful operations (as defined in the article, don’t confuse it with being lucky!) will be suitable and sufficient.

Analysing successful operations doesn’t necessarily come naturally, when nothing adverse happens it passes off as a ‘non-event’ but the objective is to look at why the operation was successful and find the many things that actually did happen to prevent failure and create your method statement accordingly.

The focus moves from what history or common practise tells us should be done to what is already working.

So, in summary, if you focus on your success you’ll continue to be successful.
